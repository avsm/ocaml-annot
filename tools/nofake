=head1 NAME

nofake - simple notangle replacement for the Noweb literate programming tool

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<nofake> [B<-R>I<chunk>] [B<-L>[I<format>]] [I<file>]

B<nofake> [B<-version>|B<-v>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Noweb(1) is a literate-programming tool like Knuth's WEB. A noweb file
contains program source code interleaved with documentation. Extracting
the source code for compilation requires notangle(1). To allow source
code to be shipped to users not using noweb(1), B<nofake> offers the
most commonly used functionality of notangle(1) as a simple perl(1)
script. Alas, B<nofake> extracts source code from a file in noweb(1)
syntax: B<nofake> reads I<file> and extracts the code chunke named
I<chunk> to stdout. If no I<file> is provided, B<nofake> reads from
stdin, if no I<chunk> is named, B<nofake> extracts the chunk C<*>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-R>I<chunk>

Extract chunk I<chunk> (recursively) from the noweb file and write it to
stdout.  Unlike notangle, only one chunk can be extracted per invocation
of B<nofake>.

=item B<-L>[I<format>]

B<nofake> emits cpp(1)-style C<#line> directives to allow a compiler
emit error messages that refer to I<file> rather than the extracted
source code directly.  The optional I<format> allows to provided the
format of the line directive: C<-L'#line %L "%F"%N'>. In I<format> C<%F>
indicates the name of the source file, C<%L> the line number, and C<%N>
a newline. The default C<#line %L "%F"%N> is suitable for C compilers.

=back

=head1 SYNTAX OF NOWEB FILES

The authoritive source for the syntax of noweb files is the noweb(1)
documentation. However, here is an example:

    <<hello.c>>=
    <<includes>>

    int main(int argc, char** argv) 
    {
        <<say hello>>
        return 0;
    }

    <<say hello>>=
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    @

    <<includes>>=
    #include <stdio.h> /* for printf */
    @

A chunk is defined by C<E<lt>E<lt>chunkE<gt>E<gt>=> and reaches up to
the next definition or a line starting with C<@>. A chunk can
recursivley refer to other chunks: chunk C<hello.c> refers to
C<includes> and C<say hello>. A chunk is referred to by
C<E<lt>E<lt>chunkE<gt>E<gt>>. To use the C<E<lt>E<lt>> and C<E<gt>E<gt>>
character literally in a program, precede them with a C<@>.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

The B<nofake> architecture is much simpler than that of notangle(1) and
therefore many things do not work. In particular:

=over 4

=item *

B<nofake> accepts the B<-R>I<chunk> option only once.

=item *

Line directives (C<#line>) are indented. In the case of cpp(1)-style
line directives this is still ANSI/ISO C conforming but might cause
problems with other directives and older versions of cpp(1).

=item *

Do not use C<@> in chunk names.

=item * 

B<nofake> does not accept the B<-filter> I<command> option that
B<notangle> uses to filter chunks before they are emitted.

=item *

A noweb file must not refer to more than one chunk per line. The
following code is I<not> handled correctly by B<nofake> because the
chunk C<*> contains two chunk references in one line.

    <<*>>=
    <<one>> <<one>>

    <<one>>=
    one
    @
